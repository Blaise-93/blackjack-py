# Blackjack Game
A blackjack game  written in python which you can play and determine whether you win or lose.
Here, we have 52 cards and all cards can be exhausted between the player and the dealer, provided 
that we have a winner. The players can actually terminate the game halfway and a winner might still
be emerged depending on the card each of the player is currtently holding. 
The `check_winner` method of `Game class` actually does that for us with while loop functionality in 
our scripts. If there is no winner, the game will continue till we have a winner. For example, when the two 
players are holding a blackjack, of course, it is a tie. The game goes on. :D

To play this amazing game all you need to do is to:

```shell
  pip i
```
